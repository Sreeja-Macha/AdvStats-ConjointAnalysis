# TV Product Analysis Suite

This suite contains two projects: Conjoint Analysis and Bootstrapped WTP Analysis. Both projects are centered around TV product strategy and provide insights into consumer preferences and valuation of product features.

## Conjoint Analysis Project

### Overview

The Conjoint Analysis project applies statistical techniques to determine how consumers value different features of TV products. The project outputs include partworths, attribute importance, and market simulations to inform optimal product design and pricing strategy.

### Components

- Input data of customer preferences.
- R Markdown script for conjoint analysis.
- Knitted HTML results of the analysis.
- Detailed report of methodology and findings.

## Bootstrapped WTP Analysis Project

### Overview

The Bootstrapped WTP Analysis extends the conjoint analysis by applying bootstrap techniques to estimate confidence intervals for willingness to pay. This advanced analysis offers a deeper dive into the financial valuation of TV features.

### Components

- R Markdown script for bootstrap regression analysis.
- Knitted HTML results of the analysis
- Output tables for each team member's WTP for TV product attributes.
- Detailed report of methodology and findings.

## General Usage

For both projects, users will require R and relevant packages installed on their machine. Data should be updated according to the current market scenario before running the scripts.

These projects are intended to provide a toolkit for analyzing and enhancing TV product strategies through consumer data analysis.
